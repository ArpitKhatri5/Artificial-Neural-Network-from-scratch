# Artificial-Neural-Network-from-scratch
<i>Nowadays, creating a deep learning algorithm is incredibly easy. Using a few libraries will allow any model to be created with only a few lines of code.<br>But I realized that this made me incredibly disconnected with the underlying principles of neural networks. The math: the calculas, linear algebra that is the backbone of neural networks. So to get back in touch with the fundamentals, I built an artificial neural network using nothing but python. No libraries, just math.
